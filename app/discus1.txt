page for searching that has the basic search paramenters
it consisted of
1.  @FromToSelector.tsx  that places api calls to get stations and map it  to display in the ui so it has an api route and a frontend that is calling it
eg
GET /api/train-classes 200 in 27899ms
GET /api/stations 200 in 28059ms
GET /api/train-classes 200 in 14809ms
GET /api/profile?email=kaluwilson@gmail.com

GET /api/routes/search?fromStationId=6809eec9c995541761db80af&toStationId=680a9542d2c9ae3ec8f76375 200 in 38544ms
GET /api/routes/search?fromStationId=6809eec9c995541761db80af&toStationId=6809eec9c995541761db80b1 200 in 543ms

2.  @DateSelector.tsx that is suppose to get schedules and from tere show active schedules
Note: currently we where able to draft out a a 3 weeks schedule  for trains, routes, stations which i seeded into my mongodb database the schema is in my api endpoints
i also have schemas for my naija rails profile and users

3  @PassengerClassSelector.tsx  this is supposed to list a travel class to select how many passengers that will be booked for the ride
This particular class selection is supposed to be used for review booing page in @BookingRight.tsx  to update the passenger

4 @Tripselector.tsx  this is part of the search parameters that takes us to train search

this process trigger a search for available routes which from there we will use and view train schedule

the trainsearch parameter handles search using different routes
using

http://localhost:3000/trains/train-search?fromStationId=6809eec9c995541761db80af&toStationId=6809eec9c995541761db80b1&date=2025-04-25&classType=SC&adultCount=3&childCount=2&infantCount=1&returnDate=2025-05-02
and as you see this passengers are are updataed in the train search
backend
GET /trains/train-search?fromStationId=6809eec9c995541761db80af&toStationId=6809eec9c995541761db80b1&date=2025-04-25&classType=SC&adultCount=3&childCount=2&infantCount=1&returnDate=2025-05-02 200 in 1096ms
