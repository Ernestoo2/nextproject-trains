4. Seed System Overhaul & Fixes (New Section)
   - **Problem**: Seeding failed repeatedly with errors like `E11000 duplicate key`, missing route connections, and incorrect schedule/day counts.
   - **Root Causes Identified**:
     - Inconsistent type definitions (`ObjectId` vs. `string`, `Date` vs. `string`) between shared types, Mongoose models, and generation logic.
     - Flawed validation logic comparing different ID types and miscounting unique days.
     - An incorrect unique index (`train_1_route_1_date_1`) present in the MongoDB `schedules` collection, conflicting with the generation of multiple schedules per day.
     - Minor bugs in route distribution and date handling during generation.
   - **Key Fixes Implemented**:
     - Aligned `ISchedule` and other relevant types with Mongoose schema requirements (e.g., `date: Date`).
     - Corrected `validation.ts` to use Mongoose document types, proper `ObjectId.toString()` for map keys/sets, and validated unique departure days (21) and schedules per route (63).
     - Ensured `routes.data.ts` generates all 30 bidirectional routes for 6 stations.
     - Ensured `schedules.data.ts` assigns the correct departure date and generates 63 schedules per route.
     - Refined route distribution in `seedOrchestrator.ts`.
     - Corrected the unique index definition in `models/Schedule.ts` to `{ train: 1, route: 1, date: 1, departureTime: 1 }`.
     - **Crucially, instructed user to manually drop the incorrect unique index (`train_1_route_1_date_1`) from the MongoDB `schedules` collection.**
   - **Outcome**: Seed process now completes successfully, generating the expected number of routes (30) and schedules (1890) with 100% coverage.

  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ seed.types.ts (shared interfaces) ‚úì
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ station.types.ts (inherited from seed.types.ts) ‚úì
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ route.types.ts (pending)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ schedule.types.ts (pending)
  ```

## üìö SEED DATA & TYPE UNIFICATION (2024-)

### Structure

- All seed data lives in: @app/utils/mongodb/seed/data/
  - stations.data.ts
  - routes.data.ts
  - trainClasses.data.ts
  - schedules.data.ts
- All seed data must use types from:
  - @app/types/shared/\*
  - @app/types/schedule/\*
- No local type/interface declarations in seed logic (e.g., seed.ts) that duplicate shared types.
- All API endpoints for seeding and data management:
  - @app/api/stations/route.ts
  - @app/api/trip-types/route.ts
  - @app/api/schedules/route.ts
  - @app/api/train-classes/route.ts
  - @app/api/seed/route.ts (main orchestrator)
- MongoDB models and seed logic must use only shared types.

### Unification Plan

1. Audit all type/interface usage in seed.ts, data/, and shared types.
2. Remove any local type/interface declarations in seed.ts that duplicate shared types.
3. Ensure all seed data and logic use only shared types.
4. Align the structure of seed data in data/ with what the API and MongoDB models expect.
5. Ensure the seeding orchestrator (seed.ts or api/seed/route.ts) uses only the unified types and data.
6. Document the unified structure and update the progress file.
