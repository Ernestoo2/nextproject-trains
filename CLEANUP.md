# Cleanup Steps for User Authentication System

## Files to Delete
These files are now redundant and should be deleted:

1. app/_context/UserContext.tsx
2. app/_providers/auth/* (entire directory)
3. app/utils/types/next-auth.d.ts (we're using the one in app/types)
4. app/store/userStore.ts (replaced by userProfileStore.ts)

## Files Modified
1. app/types/shared/users.ts - Consolidated user types
2. app/lib/auth.ts - New NextAuth configuration
3. middleware.ts - Updated route protection
4. app/(dashboard)/user/[userId]/_components/Account.tsx - Using Zustand store

## New Files Added
1. app/store/userProfileStore.ts - Zustand store for user profile
2. app/api/user/profile/[userId]/route.ts - Profile API endpoint
3. app/(dashboard)/user/layout.tsx - User layout with profile initialization

## Configuration Updates Required
1. Update .env file to include:
   ```
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 (or your domain in production)
   ```
