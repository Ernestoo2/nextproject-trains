## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- Vercel account
- Production database credentials
- API keys for external services

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.production` file with the following variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_production_nextauth_secret
TRAIN_API_KEY=your_production_train_api_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Vercel Deployment Steps

1. Install Vercel CLI:

   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:

   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy to Vercel:

   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to your project settings
   - Add all environment variables from `.env.production`

### Post-Deployment

1. Verify the deployment:

   - Check the production URL
   - Test all major features
   - Verify authentication flow

2. Set up custom domain (optional):
   - Add domain in Vercel dashboard
   - Configure DNS settings

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Security Considerations

- Keep all API keys and secrets secure
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
